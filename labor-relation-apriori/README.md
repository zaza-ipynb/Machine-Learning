This is one of the assignment that is important to understand given by 
my lecture where we perform sequential pattern analysis using Apriori Algorithm

Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database.
but for this case we are using labor relation dataset from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/labor-negotiations/C4.5/)
